# Context and Overview
Bookworms is a capstone project to put an end to four months of self-learning web development. It is intended to demonstrate proficiency with the MERN stack.

The app itself is a platform for book clubs. It enables users to propose books, vote on books, and schedule individual and group meetings for each of their book clubs.
